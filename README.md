# BraTS
BraTS Tumour Segmentation using U-Net and CNN Models. This project develops and evaluates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and U-Net architectures for segmenting tumours in MRI scans of glioma patients. The research is structured in three phases: exploring loss functions, testing architectures, and fine-tuning the best-performing models.
